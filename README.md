### Why did you build this website?

To demonstrate my programming skills, a place to showcase my work, and where people might know me better. and this may help me to get a great job.

After all, every programmer’s dream is to have a personal portfolio that shows his achievements, work, etc. 😊

### How's the performance?

From the beginning, my main focus was on speed and enhancing performance. This involved measures such as minimizing code size, optimizing images & using NEXT.js which has huge improvements overall. Like caching data requests & server-side rendering. This makes it faster in loading pages, and excellent for the user experience, in addition to a beautiful user interface & smooth animations.

## Features

- Simple, Minimal & Fast Rendering with Server Components.
- SEO Optimised along with dynamic sitemap, OpenGraph tags.
- GuestBook with Server Actions & Supabase database.
- AI assistant that answers any questions about the website & its content.
- Real-time Discord status! From [Lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard).
- Stats of all the games I own using Steam API's.
