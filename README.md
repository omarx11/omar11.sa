> ~ Hello everyone! This is the complete source code for the omar11.sa website.

### Why did you build this website?

To demonstrate my programming skills, a place to showcase my work, and where people might know me better. and this may help me to get a great job.

After all, every programmer‚Äôs dream is to have a personal portfolio that shows his achievements, work, etc. üòä

### How's the performance?

From the beginning, my main focus was on speed and enhancing performance. This involved measures such as minimizing code size, optimizing images & using NEXT.js which has huge improvements overall. Like caching data requests & server-side rendering. This makes it faster in loading pages, and excellent for the user experience, in addition to a beautiful user interface & smooth animations.

> I'm very proud of this project. I've learned a lot while developing it.

- Simple, Minimal & Fast Rendering with Server Components.
