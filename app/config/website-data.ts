I started playing and became addicted for two yearsâ€”until I destroyed my dad's computer with viruses, of course. This marked the beginning of my adventures in the vast sea of the Internet. Since then, I've always wondered how these games and websites work.",

Using an SQL Injection attack, I hacked into a website and proudly uploaded my index to its front page. I was so thrilled that I couldnâ€™t stop bragging about it at school.",
