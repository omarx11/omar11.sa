            I started using my family computer in 2011 when I was 11 years old.

            on it. I started playing and became addicted for two years—until I
            destroyed my dad's computer with viruses, of course. This marked the
            beginning of my adventures in the vast sea of the Internet. Since
            then, I've always wondered how these games and websites work.

            Like many kids fascinated by the web, my first dream was to become a
            hacker. This was before hacking became a big buzzword. I scoured
            forums and YouTube, searching for guides and tutorials, even though
            they were few and far between. My excitement never wavered, and by
            2015, I finally achieved my goal. Using an SQL Injection attack, I
            hacked into a website and proudly uploaded my index to its front
            page. I was so thrilled that I couldn’t stop bragging about it at
            school. 😅

            affected the game ignited my passion for programming. From there, I
            embarked on a self-taught journey, learning languages like Java,
            Python, PHP, and JavaScript. I found web development to be my true
            passion and have pursued it from 2019 until now.
