            I started using my family computer in 2011 when I was 11 years old.
            I started opening an account on Facebook after my cousin told me
            that there was a game called{" "}

            in it, and I started playing it and became addicted to it for two
            years after I destroyed my father's computer with viruses of course.
            From here my adventures in the sea of the Internet began, and I have
            always thought since I was young, how do these games and websites
            work?

            In the beginning, I had a goal of becoming a hacker and hacking into
            a website on the internet, and that was before something called
            hacking became famous this year. I started learning hacking from
            forums and YouTube, and the explanations were not many and clear,
            but I was excited, however in 2015 I was finally able to hack a
            website with an SQL Injection attack and I was able to upload my
            index to the front page of the website, I remember at that time I
            did not leave anyone in school without telling him that. 😅

            , since I loved the game. And in the first line I wrote the code and
            how it affected the game.. Here I started to love programming and
            began my career in it. After that, I entered into self-learning
            types of programming, including Java, Python, PHP, and JavaScript.
            The thing I loved most was web development, and I continued to do
            that from 2018 until now.
