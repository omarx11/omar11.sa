            I started using my family computer in 2011 when I was 11 years old.
            I started opening an account on Facebook after my cousin told me
            that there was a game called{" "}

            in it, and I started playing it and became addicted to it for two
            years after I destroyed my father's computer with viruses of course.
            From here my adventures in the sea of the Internet began, and I have
            always thought since I was young, how do these games and websites
            work?

            In the beginning, I had a goal of becoming a hacker and hacking into
            a website on the internet, and that was before something called
            hacking became famous this year. I started learning hacking from
            forums and YouTube, and the explanations were not many and clear,
            but I was excited, however in 2015 I was finally able to hack a
            website with an SQL Injection attack and I was able to upload my
            index to the front page of the website, I remember at that time I
            did not leave anyone in school without telling him that. üòÖ

            , since I loved the game, and in the first line I wrote in the data
            pack file and how it affected the game, here I began to love
            programming and began my career in it. After that, I entered into
            self-learning types of programming, including Java, Python,
            JavaScript, and PHP. The thing I loved most was web development, and
            I continued to do that from 2018 until now.

            It was time for me to begin my entry into the College of Technology
            in 2019 as a web programmer. After entering for a short time, I
            contracted a chronic disease called{" "}

            , by God Almighty‚Äôs will. After that, I was admitted to the hospital
            to undergo part of my colon resection. At that time, I was not sad
            at all. On the contrary, my mother, relatives, and friends were
            always visiting me, and I didn't feel tired or exhausted. I was
            discharged from the hospital after a short period. After that, I
            continued my path in life as if nothing had happened to me before!

            At the beginning of 2022, I worked on my first project, which was a
            graduation project. This was after our teacher divided us into
            teams, and each team had three people working on a project. At the
            end of the semester, our team worked hard and we were the first in
            the idea, shape, and design of the project. You can take a look at{" "}
